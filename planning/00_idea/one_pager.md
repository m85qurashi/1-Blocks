# Idea One-Pager — Multi-LLM Orchestrator + Verified Blocks

**Problem:** Fragmented AI-assisted workflows cause inconsistent quality, slow delivery, and poor traceability between orchestration flows and block implementations.

**Target Users:** Platform/App engineers, PMs, QA/SRE teams building and reviewing code via CLI/VS Code/CI.

**Solution Hypothesis:** Build Delivery A (multi-model orchestrator) + Delivery B (6-face verified blocks) integrated via Delivery C (platform layer) to enforce contract-first delivery with automated verification.

**Success Metrics (proxy):**
- -30% idea→verified cycle time.
- ≥95% BLOCKERS caught pre-merge.
- ≥80% pilot repos using orchestrated review flow.

**Alternatives:** Status quo manual reviews, single-model assistants, off-the-shelf AI IDE extensions.

**Constraints:** Security/PII policies, token budgets, vendor lock-in risk.

**Next Steps:** Enter Discovery (Phase 1) to size opportunity and refine ROI.
