Subject: 🚀 Launching Multi-LLM Orchestrator + Verified Blocks to 50+ Repos (Dec 9–20)

Hi engineering team,

Following a successful Basel-I pilot and G5 approval, we’re expanding the multi-LLM orchestrator + verified blocks program to 50+ repos between Dec 9 and Dec 20. Here’s what to expect:

Key Dates
- Nov 16–30: 10-repo soak (Phase 6) — invite-only cohorts validating tooling and training
- Dec 5: G6 gate review + Go/No-Go
- Dec 9–13: Wave 1 (10 repos)
- Dec 16–20: Wave 2 (40+ repos)

What’s launching
- Orchestrated plan→impl→review→docs flows (CLI + CI)
- 6-face BlockBlueprint workflow with contract-first testing
- Dashboards + quality gates (mutation ≥60%, coverage ≥90%, BLOCKER detection ≥90%)

What you need to do
1. Attend (or replay) the enablement sessions listed in `planning/60_launch/training/enablement_plan.md`.
2. Ensure your repo satisfies the pre-rollout checklist (run `planning/60_launch/launch_runbook.md` §1).
3. Join the shared Slack channel `#orchestrator-launch` for daily updates and support.

Support & rollout details
- Daily office hours during launch weeks (8:30–9:30 AM PT)
- Real-time monitoring via Grafana dashboards (> `planning/50_pilot/evidence/data/dashboards_summary.md`)
- Incident playbooks and rollback paths documented in `planning/60_launch/launch_runbook.md` §6–8.

Next steps
- If you’re in the 10-repo soak: expect an onboarding email today.
- Otherwise, watch for your wave assignment on Dec 6.
- Send questions to SteeringDirections or drop them in `#orchestrator-launch`.

Thanks for partnering on this milestone.
