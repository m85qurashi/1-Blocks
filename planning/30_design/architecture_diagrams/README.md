# Architecture Diagrams

Artifacts now include PlantUML sources:
- `delivery_a_sequence.puml` — FlowEngine plan flow.
- `delivery_b_components.puml` — Verified block lifecycle.
- `delivery_c_integration.puml` — Integration pathway linking TaskObject ↔ Block artifacts.

Owner: TL/Architect. Export images (PNG/SVG) as needed for decks; keep `.puml` source of record.
