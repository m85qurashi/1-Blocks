# Critical Path
1. Finalize schemas (TaskObject, BlockBlueprint, context bundle) — dependency for all downstream build.
2. Implement FlowEngine core (plan/impl/review/docs) — required before integration + pilot flows.
3. Build verification service + mutation harness — prerequisite for catalog publishing + QA gate.
4. Deliver integration service + CLI/CI flow — needed for Basel-I pilot.
5. Instrumentation & dashboards live — required before pilot review (G5).
