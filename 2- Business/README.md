# Business Persona Workspace

Structure aligns to the Comprehensive Planning Framework (v1.0) and the Multi-LLM Block Engineering Playbook.

- `persona.md` – role definition.
- `references/` – intake documents and frameworks reviewed by Business.
- `artifacts/` – Business-owned deliverables (e.g., BRD, ROI models).
- `artifacts/brd.md` – current Business Requirements Document for the Orchestrator + Blocks idea.
