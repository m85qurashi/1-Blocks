# Input Request — SRE/Security Persona

**Requester:** SteeringDirections
**Need:** Reliability/ops evidence for G4–G6 gates

## Inputs Required
1. Expand `planning/30_design/runbooks/` with detailed playbooks (flow failure, provider outage, budget breach, security incident) and link from `7-SRE/artifacts/sre_ops_plan.md`.
2. Document canary + rollback procedure specifics (traffic %, metrics) and store in `planning/40_execution/risk_register.md` or a dedicated rollout note.
3. During pilot, capture reliability soak results (success %, latency, incidents) and drop summaries/logs into `planning/50_pilot/evidence/qa/` (coordinate with QA for unified report).

Update SteeringDirections once these are committed.
