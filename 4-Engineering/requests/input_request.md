1. Finalize TaskObject + BlockBlueprint schema docs with examples for each upcoming block family (finance, compliance, observability) — ensure referenced in `planning/30_design/schemas/`.
2. Provide implementation notes / ADR references for FlowEngine, Verification Service, and Integration Service (add to `4-Engineering/artifacts/srs.md` or new ADR index).
3. Once pilot runs begin, export FlowEngine run logs + CLI command transcripts into `planning/50_pilot/evidence/qa/` for QA review.
