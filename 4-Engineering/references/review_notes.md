# Review Notes (Engineering)

Documents reviewed:
1. Governance/Comprehensive Planning Framework v1.0
2. SteeringDirections/ideas/orchestrator_blocks_framework.md
3. Multi-LLM Block Engineering Playbook v1.0

Observations:
- Delivery Plans A/B/C require contract-first design with versioned artifacts.
- Gates emphasize Technical Definition (G2) and Design Dossier (G3).
- Engineering must provide TaskObject schema, Flow specs, Block Blueprint schema, integration contracts, and runbooks.
