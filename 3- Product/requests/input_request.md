# Input Request — Product Persona

**Requested By:** SteeringDirections
**Purpose:** Ensure PRD/RTM + pilot narrative are ready for G5 review.

## Actions
1. Update `3- Product/artifacts/prd_v1.md` with any scope deltas discovered during Build and link to AC IDs.
2. Extend `planning/20_definition/acceptance_criteria.md` RTM rows with actual test file paths as Engineering/QA finalize suites.
3. Draft pilot narrative + success summary section in `planning/50_pilot/pilot_plan.md` (add “Pilot Reporting” subsection with owner + outline).

Please commit updates or drop comments so SteeringDirections can track readiness.
