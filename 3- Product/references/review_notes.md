# Review Notes (Product)

- **Governance SOP reviewed:** `0- Governance/1- Comprehensive Planning Framework (v1.0).md`
- **Idea context:** `1- SteeringDirections/ideas/orchestrator_blocks_framework.md`
- **Playbook:** `1- SteeringDirections/ideas/Multi-LLM Block Engineering Playbook (v1.0).md`

Key takeaways:
- Need PRD v1 covering Delivery A (orchestrator) and Delivery B (blocks) with clear AC + RTM seeds.
- UX flows must span CLI, VS Code, CI touchpoints.
- Gate focus: ensure G2 artifacts (PRD, contracts) and G3 design sign-off packages.
