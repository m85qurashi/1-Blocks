SteeringDirections requests that each persona completes their outstanding inputs before the next gate review. Please update your artifacts and mark the requests done.

- **Product** — Capture PRD deltas, extend RTM, add pilot narrative section in `planning/50_pilot/pilot_plan.md`.
- **Engineering** — Finalize schemas/ADRs (`planning/30_design/schemas/`, `4-Engineering/artifacts/srs.md`) and drop FlowEngine run logs into `planning/50_pilot/evidence/qa/`.
- **QA** — Fill `planning/50_pilot/evidence/qa/template_metrics.md` for each run and attach logs.
- **Data** — Provide instrumentation + dashboards per `6-Data/artifacts/measurement_plan.md` and baseline metrics in evidence folder.
